- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed. You can check by running:
  ```bash
  java -version
  javac -version
  ```
  If not installed, download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- A console or terminal to execute Java commands.

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac DrawCSE.java
   ```

2. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   java DrawCSE
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The program will generate a colorful word cloud directly in the console. Each time you run it, the names and colors will be randomized.
